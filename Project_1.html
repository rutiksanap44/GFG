    <h1>About the Legend</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Vajpayee was first elected to parliament in 1957 as a member of the
      Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), a forerunner of the BJP.</li> <br>
      <br>
      <li>In 1977 the BJS joined three other parties to form the Janata Party, which
      led a government that lasted until July 1979.</li> <br>
      <br><li>As foreign minister in the Janata government, Vajpayee earned a
      reputation for improving relations with Pakistan and China. In 1980,
      following a split in the Janata Party, Vajpayee helped the BJS to
      reorganize itself as the BJP.</li> <br>
      <br>
      <li>In 1992 he was one of the few Hindu leaders to speak out against the
      destruction of the historic mosque at Ayodhya by anti-Muslim
      extremists.</li><br>
      <br>
      <li>Sworn in as prime minister in May 1996 but was in office only 13 days,
      after failing to attract support from other parties.</li> <br>
      <br><li>In early 1998 he again became prime minister, in elections in which
      the BJP won a record number of seats, but he was forced to make a shaky
      alliance with regional parties. </li><br>
      <br><li>In 1999 the BJP increased its seats in parliament and consolidated
      its hold on government.</li>
    </ul>
